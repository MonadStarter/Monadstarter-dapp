//Multiplier
// There is no function to select stake duration in staker.sol
// add a enum so there are only 4 staking options
// any default multiplier like 0.75? or something


//Native Token
// most functions use msg.sender so native token, we need it to use any ERC20


// Tiers
In current contract, each campaign has different tier and amount requirements, instead we should keep it simple
Move the tier code to the staker contract.

// Lock
The current lock only allows IDOs to lock tokens (so that owner doesnt' run away with money)
check addIDO and onlyIDO in staker.
// Should we allow no-lock staking? In this case they get 0.75 multiplier but can stake for APR. 

// when lock ends, do people still earn the multiplier if they don't unstake?

// Staking
should take duration as a parameter. Only allow user to stake for 1 duration.
If they staked x for 30 days and want to stake y for 90 days, they need to move 30 days fund to extra 90
so it all unlocks together and multiplier is easier to calcualte
Uesrs can increase stake time but can't decrease it
