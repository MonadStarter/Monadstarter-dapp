//Multiplier
// There is no function to select stake duration in staker.sol
// add a enum so there are only 4 staking options

//Native Token
// most functions use msg.sender so native token, we need it to use any ERC20


// Tiers
In current contract, each campaign has different tier and amount requirements, instead we should keep it simple
Move the tier code to the staker contract.
